# Purpose

The purpose of this little exercise is to pull data from a Microsoft Access table. In the end, I'll read the files back in for data analyzing. The anlalyzing portion will probably be ignored in this repository, and thrown in a secondary repository. If I am able to write it in a dynamic/generic enough way, I will include it in this repository.

This is pretty much a barebones console application. It's likely to be single use, so it likely will not have any upkeep in the future.

# Note on Test File

The `Sales-Invoicing.csv` has been edited heavily, and a lot of information and fields deleted for privacy issues.
